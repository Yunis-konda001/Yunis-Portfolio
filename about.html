            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi! I’m Kumi Yunis Konda, a passionate digital innovator and advocate for refugee empowerment. I am committed to using technology 
                and education to transform the lives of underserved communities, particularly refugees.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a recent graduate of the YALI RLCA Leadership Program and Co-Founder of <strong>Fly Bring Smile</strong>, 
                I have had the privilege of leading a dedicated team to create opportunities for refugees through skills training, 
                digital literacy, and creative empowerment initiatives. I believe that with the right resources and education, 
                we can unlock the potential within refugee communities to drive positive change.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I am pursuing two academic degrees: a Bachelor’s in Software Engineering from 
                <strong>African Leadership University (Kigali, Rwanda)</strong> and an Associate of Science in Communication 
                from <strong>Southern New Hampshire University</strong>. My goal is to bridge the gap between technology 
                and social impact, particularly in the areas of digital health and community development.

            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>
                I began my journey as a child in Sudan, but due to conflict, I found myself displaced, living as a refugee in Kenya. 
                Growing up in the <strong>Kakuma Refugee Camp</strong>, I saw firsthand the challenges that refugees face—limited 
                access to digital education and opportunities. However, these challenges ignited a passion within me to be part 
                of the solution.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2020, I co-founded <strong>Fly Bring Smile</strong>, a youth-led initiative focused on uplifting the spirits 
                and futures of young refugees. Whether it’s through skills training and providing access to digital tools, our 
                mission is to inspire hope and equip people with the tools they need to shape their future.

            <h2>Why Technology?</h2>
            <p>
                My passion for technology stems from the belief that it has the power to democratize opportunities. 
                As I pursue my <strong>Bachelor’s in Software Engineering</strong>, I am particularly interested in using 
                <strong>digital health solutions</strong> to address health inequities faced by refugee populations. Whether it's 
                developing applications that improve access to healthcare or creating digital platforms that foster education and 
                employment, I am dedicated to leveraging technology for social good.
