            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi! I’m Kumi Yunis Konda, a passionate digital innovator and advocate for refugee empowerment. I am committed to using technology 
                and education to transform the lives of underserved communities, particularly refugees.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a recent graduate of the YALI RLCA Leadership Program and Co-Founder of <strong>Fly Bring Smile</strong>, 
                I have had the privilege of leading a dedicated team to create opportunities for refugees through skills training, 
                digital literacy, and creative empowerment initiatives. I believe that with the right resources and education, 
                we can unlock the potential within refugee communities to drive positive change.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I am pursuing two academic degrees: a Bachelor’s in Software Engineering from 
                <strong>African Leadership University (Kigali, Rwanda)</strong> and an Associate of Science in Communication 
                from <strong>Southern New Hampshire University</strong>. My goal is to bridge the gap between technology 
                and social impact, particularly in the areas of digital health and community development.

                <p>
                    I'm Kumi Yunis Konda—a passionate, innovative technologist and leader based in Nairobi, Kenya. As a driven Software Engineering student and recent YALI RLCA graduate, I blend my technical expertise with creative skills in front-end development, graphic design, and digital marketing to drive social impact. I co-founded Fly Bring Smile, a project dedicated to empowering refugees through innovative solutions, and have further honed my leadership skills through intensive programs like the YALI RLCA Leadership Program and the Millennium Fellowship Program. My mission is to leverage technology and digital literacy to enhance well-being and create sustainable change within communities, particularly those facing adversity.

            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>
                I began my journey as a child in Sudan, but due to conflict, I found myself displaced, living as a refugee in Kenya. 
                Growing up in the <strong>Kakuma Refugee Camp</strong>, I saw firsthand the challenges that refugees face—limited 
                access to digital education and opportunities. However, these challenges ignited a passion within me to be part 
                of the solution.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2020, I co-founded <strong>Fly Bring Smile</strong>, a youth-led initiative focused on uplifting the spirits 
                and futures of young refugees. Whether it’s through skills training and providing access to digital tools, our 
                mission is to inspire hope and equip people with the tools they need to shape their future.

            <h2>Why Technology?</h2>
            <p>
                My passion for technology is fueled by a deep conviction that it can dismantle barriers and create opportunities for everyone, especially those who face systemic inequities. Through my journey as a Software Engineering student and my hands-on experiences as Co-Founder of Fly Bring Smile, I've seen how digital solutions can transform lives in refugee communities.

                Working directly with refugees in Kakuma has opened my eyes to the urgent need for accessible, innovative tools in healthcare, education, and employment. This firsthand experience drives my commitment to develop digital health solutions and online platforms that not only improve access to vital services but also empower individuals to take charge of their futures.

                My background in front-end development, graphic design, and digital marketing equips me with a unique perspective to blend technology and creativity. I see technology not just as a tool for innovation but as a powerful force for social good—one that can bring about sustainable change, foster community resilience, and democratize opportunities for refugees and other underserved populations.
